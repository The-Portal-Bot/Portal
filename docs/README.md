<br>

Regex Interpreter: there are four types of data _(used by run command and naming portal channels)_:

1. [Variables](https://github.com/keybraker/portal/blob/master/docs/Variables.md), are immutable and live data that return information.
2. [Attributes](https://github.com/keybraker/portal/blob/master/docs/Attributes.md), are Portal's, portal or voice channel options that can be manipulated by whomever has clearance.
3. [Pipes](https://github.com/keybraker/portal/blob/master/docs/Pipes.md), are mini functions you can pass text or Variables to manipulate their outcome.
4. [Structures](https://github.com/keybraker/portal/blob/master/docs/Structures.md), are conditional flow manipulators.

_pipes are applied to variables or text in order to change their outcome_<br>
_argument preceded by **!** is **mandatory**, **@** is **optional** (not included)_
