## Infrastructure

* **[Commands](https://portal-bot.xyz/docs/commands/)**, a list of all Portal commands with description, arguments and how to use them.
* **[Text Interpreter](https://portal-bot.xyz/docs/regex/interpreter)**, is a program used by Portal when asked to generate a channel's name. It has four types of data _(used by run command and naming portal channels)_:
    1. **[Variables](https://portal-bot.xyz/docs/regex/interpreter/variables)**, are immutable and live data that return information.
    2. **[Attributes](https://portal-bot.xyz/docs/regex/interpreter/attributes)**, are Portal's, portal or voice channel options that can be manipulated by whomever has clearance.
    3. **[Pipes](https://portal-bot.xyz/docs/regex/interpreter/pipes)**, are mini functions you can pass text or Variables to manipulate their outcome.
    4. **[Structures](https://portal-bot.xyz/docs/regex/interpreter/structures)**, are conditional flow manipulators.

    _pipes are applied to variables or text in order to change their outcome_<br>
    _argument preceded by **!** is **mandatory**, **@** is **optional** (not included)_
