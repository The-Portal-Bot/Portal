## Regex Interpreter

There are four types of data:
1. [Variables](https://github.com/keybraker/portal-discord-bot/blob/master/docs/VARIABLES.md), are immutable and live data that return information.
2. [Attributes](https://github.com/keybraker/portal-discord-bot/blob/master/docs/ATTRIBUTES.md), are Portal Bot's, Portal Voice or Voice Channel options that can be manipulated by whomever has clearance. 
3. [Pipes](https://github.com/keybraker/portal-discord-bot/blob/master/docs/PIPES.md), are mini functions you can pass text or Variables to manipulate their outcome. 
4. [Structures](https://github.com/keybraker/portal-discord-bot/blob/master/docs/STRUCTURES.md), are conditional flow manipulators.
