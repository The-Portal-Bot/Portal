# 1. Introduction

We welcome any help, for example contributing feature implementations, bug fixes
and bug reports.

Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

# 2. Contributing code via GitHub

Code contributions can be performed via _pull requests_ (PR) exclusively. As a
rule-of-thumb:

- PRs should be kept at a manageable size.
- Try to focus on just one goal per PR. If you find yourself doing several
  things in a PR that were not expected, then try to split the different tasks
  into different PRs.
- Commits should always change a _single_ logical unit so that cherry-picking &
  reverting is simple.
- Commit messages should be as informative and concise as possible. The first
  line of the commit message should be < 80 characters and describe the commit
  briefly. If the 80 characters are too short for a summary, then consider
  splitting the commit. Optionally, add one blank line below the short summary
  and write a more detailed explanation if necessary.

Below we outline the recommended steps in the code contribution workflow. We use
`your-username` to refer to your username on GitHub, `portal_upstream` is used
when we set the upstream remote repository for Portal (we could have picked any
name but try to avoid already used names like, in particular, `origin` and
`master`), and we use the name `my-new-feature` for the branch that we create
(e.g., the branch name should reflect the code change being made,
keybraker-updating-music-player).

**Important**: If your PR lives for a long time, then don't press the button
_Update branch_ in the Pull Request view, instead follow the steps below, as
that avoids additional merge commits.

Once you have a GitHub login:

1. Fork Portal git repository to your GitHub account by pressing the _Fork_
   button at:
   [https://github.com/keybraker/portal](https://github.com/keybraker/portal)

2. Then start a terminal (or use your favorite git GUI app) and clone your fork
   of Portal:

       $ git clone https://github.com:your-username/portal.git
       $ cd porrtal

3. Add a new remote pointing to master Portal repository:

       $ git remote add portal_upstream https://github.com/keybraker/portal.git

   and verify that you have the two remotes configured correctly:

       $ git remote -v
       portal_upstream  https://github.com/keybraker/portal.git (fetch)
       portal_upstream  https://github.com/keybraker/portal.git (push)
       origin  https://github.com/your-username/portal.git (fetch)
       origin  https://github.com/your-username/portal.git (push)

4. Next, create a branch for your PR from `portal_upstream/master` (which we
   also need to fetch first):

       $ git fetch portal_upstream master
       $ git checkout -b my-new-feature portal_upstream/master --no-track

   NB: This is an important step to avoid draging in old commits!

5. Configure the project and check that it builds (if not, please report a bug):

       $ npm install

6. Now, make your change(s), add tests for your changes, and commit each change:

       ...

       $ git commit -m "Commit message 1"

       ...

       $ git commit -m "Commit message 2"

7. If your feature or update is event-free add testing for your changes to
   corresponding test file or a new file (if necessary)

8. Make sure all tests pass

       $ npm test

9. Push the changes to your fork on GitHub:

       $ git push origin my-new-feature

10. Create the PR by pressing the _New pull request_ button on:
    `https://github.com/your-username/portal`. Please select the option "Allow
    edits from maintainers" as outlined
    [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

11. Now wait for a portal project member(s) to respond to your PR. Follow the
    discussion on your PR at
    [GitHub](https://github.com/keybraker/portal/pulls). You may have to do some
    updates to your PR until it gets accepted. If you are inactive for more than
    three days the pull request is rejected.

12. After the PR has been reviewed you must _rebase_ your repo copy or merge
    with dev since there may have been several changes to the upstream
    repository.

    Switch to your branch again

        $ git checkout my-new-feature

    And rebase it on top of master:

        $ git pull --rebase portal_upstream master

    When you perform a rebase the commit history is rewritten and, therefore,
    the next time you try to push your branch to your fork repository you will
    need to use the `--force-with-lease` option:

        $ git push --force-with-lease

    ---

    Alternatively you can merge master to your local branch

        $ git checkout master
        $ git pull

    And now merge with your branch

        $ git merge origin/master

    > ensuring your changes are in sync with remote master is mandatory for your
    > commit to pass be aware that conflicts may apear which you must solve
    > before creating a pull request

# 3. Reporting Bugs

Bugs should be reported by creating Issues on GitHub.

> before reporting a bug first check the issue list if the bug is already
> known<br> If you cannot find any previous bug report, create a new Issue. When
> reporting a bug try to describe the problem in as much detail as possible and
> if the bug is triggered by an input file then attach that file to the GitHub
> issue if possible.
